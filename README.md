# LED Blinking Project

This repository contains the code for a basic **LED Blinking** project as part of an embedded systems task. The goal of this project is to control an LED to blink on and off at regular intervals using a microcontroller.

## Project Overview

In this project, an LED is connected to a digital I/O pin of the microcontroller. The code toggles the LED state (on/off) with a delay in between, causing the LED to blink at a specific frequency. This is a fundamental project for understanding how to interface an LED with a microcontroller and manipulate timing functions.

### Components Used:
- LED
- Resistor (220Î©)
- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, ESP32, etc.)
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

### Features:
- The LED blinks on and off with a configurable delay.
- Simple timing control using delay functions.
- Can be easily modified for various blinking patterns.

### How to Use:
1. Connect the LED to the appropriate pin on the microcontroller.
2. Upload the code to the microcontroller using the corresponding IDE (e.g., Arduino IDE).
3. Observe the LED blinking on and off at regular intervals.

### Future Improvements:
- Add a button to start/stop the blinking.
- Implement variable blink speed control using a potentiometer.
